The aim of the project is the recognition of sign language from videos . Our work is to extract the frames from 
videos which depicts the more significant frames that can help to identify exact sign by avoiding noise frames.
Extraction of frames is been done using OpenCV .From these abstacted frames the most significant ones are identified 
using activation function.
